# learning_to_speak

This repository is an attempt to implement all algorithms in the Speech and Language Processing, Second Edition book.

# Dependencies

The

```
	installations.txt

```

files contains all the libraries needed for this.

Other than this, you will need to download WordNet and word_tokenize modules using

```
	import nltk
	nltk.download()

```

in a python shell in your terminal.


# How to Run ?

The simplest method right now to access each algorithm is to go to each of the folders, if there is a

```
	run.py

```

file in the folder, you will be able to run it with simply

```
	python run.py <arguments>

```

you can access what arguments each of those run files takes using the 

```
	python run.py -h

```

option for argparse help.
